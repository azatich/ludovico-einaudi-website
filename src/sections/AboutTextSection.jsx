            Luminous, emotive, effortlessly lyrical and always supremely refined
            the music and performance of Ludovico Einaudi have attracted an ever
            growing audience over the last two decades whose diversity and
            devotion are without parallel. He has released a series of
            chart-topping albums, composed a string of award-winning film scores
            and routinely tops audience polls becoming an internet phenomenon.
            With a unique musical alchemy that draws on elements of classical,
            rock, electronica and world musics he has rendered traditional ideas
            of genre and audience divide obsolete and become one of the best
            known composers in the world today.

              Ludovico was born in Turin, Italy and trained as a classical
              composer and pianist at the Milan Conservatorio before continuing
              his studies with Luciano Berio, one of the most important
              composers of the twentieth century avant-garde. His career began
              with a series of prestigious commissions for institutions such as
              the USA’s Tanglewood Festival, Paris’ IRCAM and recently the
              National Center of Performing Arts of Beijing, but he turned away
              from what seemed a glittering classical career to forge his own
              musical path, giving him the freedom to reconcile his
              wider-ranging influences.

            It was a bold strategy but one quickly rewarded, when Ludovico’s
            electric harp suite ‘Stanze’ (1997) was first played on BBC Radio
            the switchboard jammed with listeners. It was a similar story with
            his next release Le Onde (1998), a solo piano cycle he performed
            himself.

            ‘Le Onde’ also ignited Ludovico’s career in film & television music
            and he has since composed many awardwinning scores including Doctor
            Zhivago (2002) and Sotto Falso Nome (2004). In recent years Shane
            Meadows’ acclaimed film This Is England (2006) and its television
            sequel This Is England ’86 (2010) have brought a BAFTA nomination
            for Ludovico and introduced his music to a huge new audience. In
            2011 another acclaimed film used his music: Intouchables by Olivier
            Nakache and Eric Soledano. Ludovico built on the impact of ‘Le Onde’
            with a series of albums notable for their exuberant experimentation.
            Eden Roc (1999) saw an array of guest musicians and instruments
            ranging from electric guitar to the Armenian duduk. ‘I Giorni’
            (2001) deepened this engagement with world music in Ludovico’s
            second collection for solo piano. His ‘best of’ collection from
            these first four albums, Echoes: The Einaudi Collection (2003), has
            since gone to sell more than 100,000 copies.‘Le Onde’ also ignited

            As Ludovico’s fame grew, his concert schedule naturally grew along
            with it and became an increasingly important part of his life. It
            immediately led to two new albums, Diario Mali (2005), a
            collaboration with kora virtuoso Ballaké Sissoko and his first live
            solo album La Scala Concert 03.03.03 (2003), recorded in his adopted
            city of Milan. The release of Una Mattina’ (2004) saw more ‘firsts,’
            it was Ludovico’s debut album on new and current record label
            Universal and also his most ‘classical’ to date. Largely written for
            solo piano, it leapt to the top of the UK classical album chart and
            gave him his first sold-out UK tour. Ludovico remains one of the
            most popular composers in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe.
